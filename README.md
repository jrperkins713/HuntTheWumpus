# Hunt The Wumpus! #

BACKGROUND  
Hunt the Wumpus is a text based game originally written by Gregory Yob in 1975. Yob's game contains twenty chambers,  
each connected to three others. The player is given text clues based off of the contents of the adjacent chambers, with  
the ultimate goal of locating the Wumpus, and firing an arrow into its chamber. To increase the difficulty, Hunt the  
Wumpus also includes other obstacles, such as bottomless pits, and bats.  

INSTRUCTIONS  
To win, the player must fire an arrow into the Wumpus’s square  
The player loses if they move into the Wumpus’s square, fall into the bottomless pit, or run out of arrows  

Move charter (red square) with WASD  
Fire arrows with ARROW KEYS  
Texted based clues will be given based on what hides in the surrounding squares  

Bats lift the player to a random square  
The player may pick up arrows of less successful hunters  
If the player shoots an arrow into the wrong square, the Wumpus could move to an adjacent square  
The Wumpus is too heavy to be lifted by bats, and cannot fall into a bottomless pit.
